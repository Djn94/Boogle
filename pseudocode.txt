make mongodb googlebooks
Connect mongo thru mongeese
create a Book schema with title, authors, description, image, link
create similar application, so the state needs to be saved or search and have a route example to switch which component to display
components--
---header, <h1> React google books search</h1><p class="instrucText">Search for and Save Books of Interest </p
---<searchpage?>
------<searchDiv>--in this component the <p>Book Search

<search bar input>
all those onclick functions from the app.js 
<submit button w the onclick that runs the handleClick function> >> need handleClick function from props
------</searchDiv>

	an axios pull to retrieve the data from the database?

	a function to apply the results to the <searchResultsDivBox>,
book Title, authors, description, image, and source link applied to the view button
	needs a saved button with onclick function to ajax post book information
also a view button that links to the page link with a _target blank to open new in tab
	</that> div
<searchresultsDiv>
	
</searchDiv>
or
<savedDiv>
<sameHeader></sameHeader>
<savedDiv>
	<savedDivBox>
		results from the axios pull from savedTo database
seperate axios call to retrieve from db.savedTo.results?
	</savedDivBox>
</savedDiv>

Or try out some home made .scss maybe, if there's time

Express routes needed-

/api/books - get - return all saved books in .JSON
/api/books - post - post to save clicked book information on savedT0 database
/api/books/:id - delete- delete books from nogo by '_id'
* - get - loads page in client/build/index.html, after all
create react appS
